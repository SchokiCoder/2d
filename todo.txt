movement:
{
	-add crouching							.
	-add crouch slide						.
}

old problems (from c):
{
	-motd is bugged				.
	-unused variable warnings		.
}

renaissance:
{
	-remove dep SDL2_ttf						.
	-add image fontmap						.
	 monospcae, utf-8, no rgb image
	 represent ALL characters as filled square except:
	 latin characters, numbers, common special chars ,;.:-_ etc
	 (by including all utf-8 characters we can iterate
	  through the parsed data with the actual character like 'a')

	-c2								.
	
	-remove block-based world building				.
	-add images as maps						.
	 In this case, i think a hotswap system for quickly changing
	 maps is needed. So that developing a map as a picture can be
	 easily cut into multiple pictures.
	 Maybe a trigger could be named via a layer name of a XCF-file.
	 Those layers could then be given behavior with a LUA script.
	 A layer could also just be a static thing and in the extending
	 LUA file properties could be given such as "is a liquid" or
	 "not solid".
	 In a lua file you could assign the existing layernames an
	 actual purpose.
	 Or maybe JSON-file?

	-set version to 0.1.0						.

rehab:
{
	-finish Makefile			v
	-fix application metadata		v
	-fix linker error			v
	-Config_save -> Config_to_file		v
	-are debug builds actually valid	v
	 (because o-files are not compiled
	 with -g or -D _DEBUG)
	-same ^ for -Os				v
	-fix segfault				v
	 this is due to not finding the font
	 (has no NULL check lol)
	 actual fix postponed due to obsolesence
	-double free on game start		v
	-add cc sa license to assets		v
