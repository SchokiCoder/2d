# What is this

A 2d game engine and an absolute hellscape of bad legacy code that i kicked down the road for way years.
The code is partially from 2019, back when i was so bad at everything that i can't comprehend it now.
I copy-paste-rewrote that pile multiple times aka. this used to be even worse!
DON'T DO THIS, a NON-COPY-PASTE rewrite is easier and better.
